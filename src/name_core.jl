# This is the core functionality for manipulating dimension names as express as a tuple
# It is central to the performance of this named dimensions as a zero cost abstraction
# For constant input all functions should constant propagate to constant output.
# Each function in this file is annotated with a comment and a benchmark
# running that benchmark should return 0 allocations,
# and you can swap its `@btime` for `@code_typed` to check if it is constant propergating
# This constant propagate lets us write faily naive code elsewhere in the package
# knowing the creation and destruction of NamedDimsArrays will be optimised away.

"""
    compile_time_return_hack(x)

This is a cunning hack to strongly encourage the compiler to use constant propagation,
when returning a `Tuple` of `Symbols`.
Under normal circumstances, constant propergation will not work to fully compute
returned tuples of non-bits types.
But because `Symbol`s are a allowed in type-parameters (unlike other nonbits types),
we can put them into a type-parameter, which triggers (??different??) constant propergation,
(for ??Reasons??)
and once something is a type-parameter, then extracting it and returning it is non-allocating.

See https://discourse.julialang.org/t/zero-allocation-tuple-subsetting/23122/8

The short version of this is:
if a function returns a tuple of symbols and is allocating when it looks like it shouldn't
then try wrapping its returned value in `compile_time_return_hack`.
and then look at the `@code_lowered` again.

 - similarly: `(:a, :_)` and `(:a, :b)` can also be unified to give `(:a, :b)`

 - `(:a, :b)` and `(:a, :b, :c)` cannot be unified as they have different lengths
